    * @class Game
    * @brief Manages the core gameplay functionality.
    *
    * @section Basic Information
    * The Game class handles the initialization of game elements, manages the main game loop, and processes player actions.
    *
    * @section Key Responsibilities
    * Coordinates the game environment, including player interactions, inventory management, and game state.
    * - **Initialization**: Sets up the game environment by creating and initializing key elements
    *
    * - **Game Loop**: Manages the continuous loop of the game, processing player actions, updating the game state, and
    *   rendering the environment until the game is terminated.
    *
    * - **Action Handling**: Determines and executes actions based on player input, including player movement, menu navigation,
    *   and item interactions.
    *
    * - **Inventory Management**: Manages the player's inventory, including accessing items, using them, and discarding them.
    *
    * - **Game State Management**: Controls the game's continuation or termination based on player decisions and game events.
    *
    * The Game class acts as the main controller for game operations.*/
