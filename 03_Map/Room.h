 * A room is a single navigable area in which the player can move around. Rooms are interconnected by portals,
 * allowing the player to travel between different rooms. Multiple rooms together form a "location," and all locations
 * combined create the full game mapâ€”the overall area in which the player can explore and interact.
 * 
 * Each tile in the room can either represent empty space, a wall, or contain an entity such as an enemy, item, or player.
